German Road Sign Classification using tensorflow

In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs.

Dataset used: German Traffic Sign Dataset. This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.

I was able to reach a 99% validation accuracy, and a 97 % testing accuracy.

Pipeline architecture:
	Load The Data.
	Data Preprocessing.
	Design a Model Architecture.
    		LeNet-5.
    		VGGNet.
	Model Training and Evaluation.
	Testing LeNet-5 and VGGNet Model Using the Test Set.
	Testing the Model on New Images.
